Project name: Fitness Saviour

Brief Description: 
A full-stack fitness website built using C#, Blazor and SQL server.
Provides personalised diet, exercise, and workout split reccomendations based on user input. Allows users to track data such as calories and macros. 
Developed independently as part of my coursework for A level computer science.

Goal:
Help users make informed and sustainable decisions when it comes to fitness.

Tech Stack:
Frontend --> Blazor (razor components), HTML, CSS
Backend --> C#, Entity Framework Core
Database --> SQL Server



Features: 
Users log calories that build up on an accumulator with daily targets to be met. Calories can be burnt through exercise and gained through food.
Personalised Diet Recommendations
Users complete a questionnaire covering goals, preferences, and constraints
Diets are ranked using a scoring algorithm based on user responses
Results are presented in a clear, ordered format
Exercise Guidance System
Generates general exercise recommendations (e.g. cardio, resistance, flexibility)
Designed to guide users without prescribing unsafe or overly specific routines
Data-Driven Application
Uses a SQL Server database to store food data, exercises, and application logic
Queries are structured to support filtering and scoring logic
Interactive User Interface
Built with Blazor components
Dynamic rendering based on user selections
Clean, accessible layout
Data Visualisation
Displays dietary breakdowns and results using charts
Helps users understand recommendations visually rather than only through text

Motivations:
Fitness related (hobby)
Gain experience with full-stack development
